# SkibidiWeather
SkibidiWeather is a small web app that utilizes the OpenWeather API to display historical as well as future weather data in any location in the world.

The aim of this project is to hone my front-end dev skills and visualization of modern interfaces.

In this project, I will be using the [Next.js framework](https://nextjs.org/) to build the webapp, and use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the website. I will also be using beautifully designed components from the [Shadcn/ui library](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

This project will also have me handle data from the backend, which is data from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

This is just a sketch, but this is what I want the weather dashboard to look like when I'm finished:
